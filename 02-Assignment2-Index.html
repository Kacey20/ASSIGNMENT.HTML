                <p>Satire is a tough genre for so many students. The popular satirical online news magazine The Onion comes to the
                    rescue
                    here with a hysterical piece that, while not a short story exactly, certainly tells a tale students will guffaw
                    over. In
                    the article, students learn the plight of a young man who almost received severe consequences for driving while
                    under
                    the influence. Some satirical pieces are almost too serious for students to see as satire, but this one does a
                    great job
                    of taking a serious subject and turning it on its head to make a point.

                    In class: This piece is perfect for students who aren’t ready to grapple with some of the more complex satirical
                    pieces
                    they’re often given in school. If your group isn’t quite ready for Swift’s A Modest Proposal, this is a great
                    place to
                    start. As an introduction to satire, pairing this piece with actual news reports of cases where privileged young
                    people
                    have received shockingly light sentences for serious crimes will definitely keep your students engaged (and
                    enraged?).</p>

                <p>This short story caper takes on the classic detective trope and mocks it mercilessly. Over-the-top costumes,
                    mistaken
                    identities, and a ridiculous reveal make this a truly funny short story to share with your students.

                    In class: I wish I still taught the mystery unit I taught for many years so that I could add this funny short
                    story to
                    the mix. This is a perfect piece to introduce satire. It mocks many of the most common elements of typical
                    detective
                    stories in a truly hilarious fashion.</p>
